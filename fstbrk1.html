            Learning web development has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences in my life. Admittedly, early on
            it was a struggle to stay engaged but I was adament on learning, I just needed to find the best way to do it.
            I found that by building applications that were fun and interesting to me I could learn far better than by just
            doing the standard assignments.<br> Basketball has always been a passion of mine. The sports blend
            of graceful skill, sportsmanship and community has had a profound affect on me and was the driving force inspiring
            this application.<br> My goal was to design a turned based basketball game that would encompass the spirit of
            the game and Fst brk is the first step toward my desire to build a full fledge turned based strategy basketball
            game.

                With the early build I wanted to keep the game logic fairly simple by using basic Html, Css, and Javascript. For the next
                version I plan on building it with react.js and socket.io similar to the build of 21 Vice project.

            It was really important for me to emphasize the backgrounds to give the design character. Also I wanted to put special emphasis

            The character and court designs were inspired by outdoor street basketball. I wanted to evoke the feeling of youth by making

            One of the major challenges I faced when building this application was getting the buttons to change from offense to defense
            when either the user of computer won a round. I resolved this but using the toggle() method that would switch
            between two sets of buttons when a certain condition was met.
