            <h1>About</h1>
            <p><i>"I believe a good designer is not just a person who soley makes aesthetically pleasing works; They are
                    also avid listeners, open communicators, and imaginative problem solvers who strive to work cooperatively
                    to complete a common goal."</i>

                <br><br> I started my graphic design career back in 2015. In the beginning, I was designing illustrations
                and logos for friends and family but quickly realized that in order to expand my clientele and advance my
                career I needed to adopt a professional attitude and good entrepreneurial habbits. I made it a priority to utilize
                my free time to scope out and attend events to network and solicit my services, research and learn the industries
                trends and best practices, and critique and learn from my experiences with clients in order to perfect my
                skills and business. Over time I expanded to working with start ups and small businesses but was still unsatisfied
                with only working on a freelance basis. Driven by my desire to continuously trend upward, I enrolled in the
                University of Pennsylvania's coding bootcamp in the summer of 2018 to learn full stack web development with
                the goal of advancing my career as a designer. Currently, I am still working as freelance designer producing
                design assets for web and print media. My goal is to contribute my unique skillset and experience in a more
                professional and structure setting, as a full time designer and developer.
